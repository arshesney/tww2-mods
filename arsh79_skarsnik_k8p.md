# Skarsnik starts in Karak Eight Peaks

I was tired seeing AI's Skarsnik idling by Karak Azgaraz the whole time or worse, getting peaced out by the Mutinous Gits.
So here's a simple mod that gives him control of Karak Eight Peaks [u]only when played by AI[/u]: da boss' back gitz!

[list]
[*]Crooked Moon Muntinous Gitz removed
[*]Skarsnik (and Sly da Miser) moved to Karak Eight Peaks
[*]Skarsnik gets a few extra units (Goblin shaman, Night Goblin, Night Goblin Archers and Trolls) and som experience akin to what Mutinous Gitz would get
[*]Karak Azgaraz goes back to Karak Norn
[/list]

No database or startpos edits, the mod is a simple script that fires at new game start, checks if Skarsnik is a player and if not, does its stuff. The mod also fires the Karak Eight Peaks conquered event: Belegar and Queek adjust their AI accordingly and hopefully actually go for their objective.

Should be compatible with pretty much anything that doesn't touches Karak Eight Peaks factions game setup, sadly the mod that inspired my work: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1225968244]Karak Eight Peaks at Campaign Start[/url] by Crynsos is one of them.

Thank you for trying out my mod and please leave a thumbs up if you like it.
