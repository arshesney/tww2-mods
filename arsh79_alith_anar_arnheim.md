# Alith Anar start in Arnheim

Moves Alith Anar starting location to Arnheim, only for the Vortex campaign:

[list]
[*]Tiranoc only in Ulthlan
[*]Black Creek Spire given to Karond Kar
[*]Alith Anar to Arnheim and at war with Clar Karond
[/list]

The game will start looking at Black Creek Spire regardless, because of the scripted intro.

No database or startpos edits, the mod is a simple script that fires at new game start, pretty much compatible with anything.

Thank you for trying out my mod and please leave a thumbs up if you like it.
